The answers to HW1 Questions 1-3 are in hw1q123.txt.
The code for HW1 Questioin 4 is in hw1q4.cpp.
The code for HW1 Question 5 is in hw1q5.cpp.

I did my best on Question 5, but it doesn't work correctly. Hopefully I will get some partial credit. I think my logic is along the right path. I shouldn't have memory leaks.

Thank you so much and have a wonderful day!
